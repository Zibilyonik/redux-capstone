# Game Rating
A lightweight React/Redux project that displays all the monsters listed in the 5th Edition of Dungeons and Dragons API. All the data is retrieved from the D&D [API](https://api.open5e.com/monsters/), and presented for users to enjoy.




## Project Description
This project combines the use of JavaScript, React/Redux, HTML/CSS and Bootstrap to provide an optimized experience for mobile users.

Using this project, users can browse the large list of monsters and learn about their challenge ratings, click on monsters to access detailed information, and use the search function to filter the list of monsters by name.

The main landing page displays a grid of item cards, which has the name of the monster as the title, and the monster's challenge rating as the secondary title.

Users can click on the card of the monster to open up a new page that displays the detailed information about the monster.
